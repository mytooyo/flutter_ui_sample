# Flutter UI Sample

Sample designs for application sign-in, credit card application, and fan site detail pages.  
I hope you will find this information useful for designing in Flutter.  

I will be modifying the source code and adding designs as needed.  
If you have a design that you would like to use as a reference, we will be ready to accept it via Twitter in the future.
